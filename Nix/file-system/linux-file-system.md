## Linuxt Tutorial - Part 3 : Linux File System

In Linux, everything is represented as files, or more accurately, everything in Linux can be accessed and manipulated through the filesystem, which is structured as a hierarchy of directories and files. This concept is known as the "everything is a file" philosophy.

Files and directories are fundamental concepts in Linux filesystems, providing a structured way to organize and access data stored on storage devices. They play a crucial role in managing system resources, running programs, and storing user data.

So letâ€™s look into some of the Linux important files and directories.

**/ (root Directory):**
+ The root directory is the top-level directory in the filesystem hierarchy.
+ All other directories and files are located either directly beneath the root directory or within subdirectories.
+ The root directory contains essential system files and directories necessary for booting and operating the system.

**/bin (Binaries):**
+ The /bin directory contains essential binary executables (programs) required for system booting and functioning, accessible to all users.
+ Common commands and utilities such as ls (for list directory contents), cp (for copying), mv ( for moving), and rm (for removing) are located here.

**/sbin (System Binaries):**
+ The /sbin directory contains binary executables (programs) that primarily used by super users or system administrators for system management and maintenance tasks and hence it has s initial.
+ Utilities in this directory often require administrative privileges to execute which is also know as sudo (or super user do)

**/etc (Configuration Files):**
+ The /etc directory contains system-wide configuration files and directories used by various applications and services.
+ Configuration files for network settings, user accounts, services, and system startup are typically stored here.

**/dev (Device Files):**
+ The /dev directory contains special device files representing hardware devices connected to the system.
+ Device files for disks, partitions, terminals, printers, network interfaces, and other devices are located here.
+ For eg, if you plug in a new webcam or USB pendrive into your Linux machine then a new device entry will automatically pop up here.

**/proc (Process Information):**
+ The /proc directory is a virtual filesystem that provides information about running processes and system resources.
+ Each process has a corresponding directory containing information such as process ID, status, memory usage, and file descriptors.

**/sys (Sysfs Filesystem):**
+ The /sys directory is another virtual filesystem similar to /proc, providing information about kernel and device parameters.
+ It exposes kernel data structures and allows system administrators to interact with and configure kernel settings dynamically.

**/var (Variable Data):**
+ The /var directory contains variable data files that change frequently during system operation.
+ Log files, spool directories (for printing and email), and temporary files generated by applications are typically stored here.

**/tmp (Temporary Files):**
+ The /tmp directory is used for storing temporary files created by applications and users.
+ Files in /tmp are typically deleted upon system reboot or periodically by system cleanup utilities.

**/home (User Home Directories):**
+ The /home directory contains home directories for system users.
+ Each user typically has a subdirectory under /home where they can store personal files and configuration settings.

**/usr (User Binaries and Libraries):**
+ The /usr directory contains user binaries, libraries, documentation, and other files not required for system booting.
+ User-installed applications and their associated files are often stored under /usr.

**/opt (Optional Packages):**
+ The /opt directory is used for installing optional software packages not provided by the distribution's package manager.
+ Third-party software and applications may install their files and directories under /opt.

**/boot**
+ Contains all the files that are required for a successful booting process.

These are some of the key directories in the Linux directory structure, providing a hierarchical organization for system files, user data, and configuration settings. Understanding the purpose and layout of these directories is essential for managing and administering a Linux system effectively.

Linux and Automation tools are transforming the way organizations build and manage IT infrastructure. By embracing these technologies and best practices, businesses can achieve greater agility, scalability, and resilience in today's dynamic digital environment.
