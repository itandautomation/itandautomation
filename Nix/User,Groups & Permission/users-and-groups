Linux Tutorial for Beginners - Part10: Understanding Users and Groups in Linux
What are Users?
A user in Linux is an account that is created for a person or a process that needs to interact with the system. Each user has a unique username and password and is assigned a User ID (UID). The UID is used to identify the user to the system and determine the user's permissions and privileges.

What are Groups?
A group in Linux is a collection of users who share common access privileges. Each group has a unique Group ID (GID) that is used to identify the group to the system and determine the group's permissions and privileges. Groups make it easier to manage access control by associating users with similar access requirements.

Types of Users and Groups
There are two types of users in Linux:

Superuser (root) and
Regular users
The Superuser has complete control over the system and can perform any operation, while regular users are limited to the resources assigned to them. Similarly, there are two types of groups in Linux:

Primary and
Secondary groups.
The Primary group is the group that is assigned to a user when the user account is created. A Secondary group is a group that a user can be added to later.

Managing Users in Linux
Creating New Users: To create a new user in Linux, we can use the useradd command. This command creates a new user account and assigns a UID and GID. The syntax for creating a new user is: useradd [options] username
Modifying User Accounts: To modify a user account in Linux, we can use the usermod command. This command enable administrators to modify user account attributes such as username, primary group, password, UID, GID, login shell, home directory, and many more attributes of any user. This command automatically updates the value of these user account attributes in the respective system files. The syntax for modifying a user account is: usermod [options] username
Deleting User Accounts: To delete a user account, we can use the userdel command. This command removes the user's account and home directory. The syntax for deleting a user account is: userdel [options] username
Managing Groups in Linux
Creating New Groups: To create a new group in Linux, we can use the groupadd command. This command creates a new group and assigns a GID. The syntax for creating a new group is:groupadd [options] groupname

Adding Users to a Group: To add a user to a group in Linux, we can use the usermod command with the -aG option. This command adds a user to an existing group. The syntax for adding a user to a group is: usermod -aG groupname username

Modifying Group Accounts: To modify a group account in Linux, we can use the groupmod command. This command allows us to change the group's name and GID. The syntax for modifying a group account is:groupmod [options] groupname

Deleting Group Accounts: To delete a group account in Linux, we can use the groupdel command. This command removes the group from the system. The syntax for deleting a group account is: groupdel groupname
