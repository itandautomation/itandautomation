## Linux Tutorial - Part 1 : History & Background

### Why Linux?

Learning Linux is important in IT work for several reasons:
+ **Widely Used Operating System:** It is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, powering a vast array of devices, servers, and systems. Many organizations, from small businesses to large enterprises, rely on Linux for their IT infrastructure.
 
+ **Versatility:** meaning it can be adapted to various use cases, including web servers, database servers, network appliances, IoT devices, and more. Its flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications and industries.

+ **Open Source:** which means its source code is freely available to view, modify, and distribute. This fosters a vibrant community of developers and contributors who continually improve and enhance the operating system.
 
+ **Cost-Effective:** Linux is cost-effective compared to proprietary operating systems like Windows. It is available for free, and there are no licensing fees associated with its use. This makes it an attractive option for organizations looking to minimize their IT expenses.
 
+ **Security:** It offers strong user permissions, access controls, and built-in security mechanisms to protect against malware, viruses, and other security threats.
 
+ **Career Opportunities:** Linux is highly valued in the IT industry and can open up a wide range of career opportunities. Many IT roles, such as system administrators, network engineers, DevOps engineers, platform engineers, SRE, cloud architects etch require Linux skills.

+ **Cloud Computing:** Linux is the dominant operating system in cloud computing environments. Major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer extensive support for Linux-based virtual machines and containers.
 
+ **DevOps and Automation:** It plays a crucial role in DevOps practices and automation workflows. Many automation tools, scripting languages, and configuration management frameworks are designed to work seamlessly with Linux systems.

So overall, learning Linux is very essential for IT professionals looking to stay competitive in today's technology-driven world. It provides a strong foundation for building expertise in various IT disciplines and enables individuals to tackle complex challenges in diverse environments.

### History & Background

+ **First created by Linus Torvalds in 1991:**
Linux is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system kernel first created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 

+ **Core component of many Linux distributions:**
It's the core component of many Linux distributions, which are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel and include various software packages such as utilities, libraries, and applications

+ **Used for desktops, servers and embedded devices:** Linux distributions combine the Linux kernel with additional software like utilities, libraries, and graphical interfaces to create complete operating systems used for desktops, servers, and embedded devices.

### Linux Distributions
There are hundreds of Linux distributions available, each with its own focus, target audience, and set of features. Some of the most well-known and widely used Linux distributions:

+ **Ubuntu:** One of the most popular desktop Linux distributions, known for its user-friendly interface and extensive software repository. It's based on Debian and offers long-term support (LTS) releases.

+ **Debian:** A stable and versatile distribution that forms the basis for many other distributions, including Ubuntu. Debian is known for its commitment to free software principles and its robust package management system.

+ **Fedora:** Developed by the Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat, Fedora is a cutting-edge distribution that showcases the latest open-source technologies. It's often used by developers and enthusiasts who want to stay on the leading edge of software development.

+ **CentOS:** A community-driven distribution based on the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS is known for its stability and long-term support, making it popular for server deployments.

+ **Kali Linux:** Designed for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts, Kali Linux is packed with tools for penetration testing, digital forensics, and security auditing. It's based on Debian and is widely used in the security community.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other Linux distributions tailored for specific purposes, such as gaming (e.g., SteamOS), education (e.g., Edubuntu), and multimedia production (e.g., Ubuntu Studio). Additionally, there are niche distributions focused on specific hardware platforms or specialized use cases.

### How Linux works?

Linux works as an operating system, providing a platform for computer hardware and software to interact.

+ **Kernel:** At the core of Linux is the kernel, which is responsible for managing the system's resources and providing essential services such as process management, memory management, device drivers, and file system management. It interacts directly with the hardware to provide a consistent interface for higher-level software.

+ **User Space:** So above the kernel lies the user space, where user applications and system utilities run. These include graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line tools, daemons (meaning background processes), and various system services. User-space programs communicate with the kernel through system calls, which allow them to request resources or perform operations.

+ **File System:** Linux uses a hierarchical file system to organize data on storage devices. The file system provides a structured way to store and access files and directories, with each file and directory represented by an inode (index node). Common file systems used in Linux include ext4, XFS, Btrfs, and others. Linux also supports a wide range of file system types, including those native to other operating systems like FAT and NTFS.

+ **Shell:** Linux provides a command-line interface (CLI) known as the shell, which allows users to interact with the system using text commands. The shell interprets user input, executes commands, and manages processes. Bash (also known as Bourne Again Shell) is the default shell for most Linux distributions.

+ **Processes:** In Linux, a process is an instance of a running program. The kernel manages processes, scheduling them for execution on the CPU and providing each process with its own virtual memory space. Processes can run in the foreground or background, and they can communicate with each other through inter-process communication mechanisms provided by the kernel.

+ **Networking:** Linux includes comprehensive networking capabilities, allowing computers to communicate over local area networks (LANs) and the internet. The kernel provides support for various networking protocols, such as TCP/IP, UDP, and HTTP, as well as networking features like routing, firewall, and network device management.

+ **Security:** Linux incorporates numerous security features to protect the system and its users. This includes user and group permissions, access control lists (ACLs), file system encryption, firewall, and security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) which provide mandatory access control mechanisms.

So overall, Linux operates by providing a stable and efficient platform for running a wide range of applications and services. Its modular design, open-source nature, and extensive community support make it a popular choice for everything from personal computers to servers, embedded devices, and supercomputers.
