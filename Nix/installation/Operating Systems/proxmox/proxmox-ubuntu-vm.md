Hi Welcome to IT & Automation
Today We will be looking into installation of Ubuntu and while doing that we will look at 
Overview of Proxmox virtual environment too.

We shall touch upon
Allocation of Resources such as Disk / CPU / Memory

And walk through of installation process.

Once the installation is complete, we shall install few tools and enable ssh
In order to be able to login via seperate machine in the bridge network.

Lets get started 

Here, you can see Proxmox, which is logged in view, 

And you can see bunch of options, for this video we shall jump into far right corner where 
it says Create VM.

Create CT is for containers.

We press Create VM;


It gives me a modal window; 

In General Tab, 
we  assign Node (where you want your guest to run on)
VM ID; it is autoassigned number, or you can give your own number as long as it doesnot get conflict.
