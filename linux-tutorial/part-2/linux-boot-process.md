## Linuxt Tutorial - Part 2 : Linux Boot Process

The Linux boot process is a series of steps that occur when a computer is powered on or restarted.

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization:** BIOS Stands for Basic Input Ouput System and UEFI Stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
+ When we first turn on our computer, BIOS or  UEFI starts executing which means it initializes hardware components such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices.
+ It performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check for hardware errors. So if there are any hardware errors then you can see them on BIOS/UEFI screen.
2. **Bootloader/ GRUB Stage 1:**
+ In Stage 1 - after the hardware initialization, the BIOS/UEFI locates and loads the boot loader from the boot device.
+ The most common boot loader in Linux systems is the GRUB which stands for Grand Unified Boot Loader.
+ GRUB Stage 1 is loaded into memory and executes its primary function: locating and loading the Stage 2 bootloader.

3. **Bootloader/ GRUB Stage 2:**
+ GRUB Stage 2 is more complex than Stage 1 and is capable of understanding filesystems.
+ It loads the kernel image and initial RAM disk (or initramfs) into memory.
+ The kernel image and initramfs are typically located on the filesystem, and GRUB uses filesystem drivers to access them.
4. **Linux Kernel Initialization:** 
+ Once the kernel image and initramfs are loaded into memory, the Linux kernel starts executing.
+ The kernel performs hardware detection and initialization, such as identifying CPU, memory, storage devices, and other hardware components.
+ It mounts the root filesystem, which contains the operating system's files.
5. **Init Process (Systemd):**
+ After the kernel initialization, the init process is executed.
+ In modern Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, systemd is the default init system.
+ systemd initializes the user space, starts essential system services, and manages system processes.
6. **User Space Initialization:**
+ Once systemd starts, it executes system startup scripts, services, and daemons according to the configured system targets.
+ User sessions may also be initialized, providing a graphical or command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
7. **Login Prompt:**
+ Finally, after the initialization of user space, the system presents a login prompt to users.
+ Users can log in using their credentials to access the system and start using the installed applications and services.

This sequence of steps constitutes the Linux boot process, starting from hardware initialization to user login. It is really good to understand each of these stages as it helps in troubleshooting boot issues and optimizing system startup performance.
