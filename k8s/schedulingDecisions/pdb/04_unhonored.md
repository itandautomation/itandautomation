Kubernetes strives to honor Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) and maintain application availability within the constraints specified by the PDB.
However, there are certain scenarios where Kubernetes may not be able to fully comply with the PDB:

1. **Insufficient Resources**
    
2. **Unplanned Disruptions**
    
3. **Forced Evictions**
    
4. **Misconfigurations**
    
5. **Manual Overrides**
    

Overall, while Kubernetes aims to adhere to PDB constraints wherever possible,
there may be exceptional circumstances where strict compliance is not feasible, 
or practical due to operational constraints or cluster conditions.
